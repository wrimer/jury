        <p>LCD screens are uniquely modern in style, and the liquid crystals that make them work have allowed humanity
          to create slimmer, more portable technology than weâ€™ve ever had access to before. From your wrist watch to
          your laptop, a lot of the on the go electronics that we tote from place to place are only possible because of
          their thin, light LCD display screens. Liquid crystal display (LCD) technology still has some stumbling blocks
          in its path that can make it unreliable at times, but on the whole the invention of the LCD screen has allowed
          great leaps forward in global technological progress.
