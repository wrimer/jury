        <p> LCD screens are uniquely modern in style, and the liquid crystals that make them work have allowed humanity
          to
          create slimmer, more portable technology than weâ€™ve ever had access to before. From your wrist watch to your
          laptop, a lot of the on the go electronics that we tote from place to place are only possible because of their
          thin, light LCD display screens. Liquid crystal display (LCD) technology still has some stumbling blocks in
          its
          path that can make it unreliable at times, but on the whole the invention of the LCD screen has allowed great
          leaps forward in global technological progress.</p>
